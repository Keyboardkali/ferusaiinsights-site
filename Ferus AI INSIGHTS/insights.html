        <p>
          Below are examples of the types of signals that come out of our trackers and deep-dive
          reports. Client work includes full data tables, methodology notes and segment cuts tailored
          to your needs.

          <h3>Specialised copilots beat generic chatbots</h3>
          <p>
            In developer and finance workflows, narrow AI copilots designed around a specific stack
            or process consistently outperform generic chatbots on retention. Teams value “gets my
            workflow” more than “largest possible model”.

        </div>

          <h3>Experimentation budgets are tight</h3>
          <p>
            Many teams pay for AI tools from experimentation or productivity budgets. Tools positioned
            as strategic infrastructure win higher ARPU and longer commitments than tools framed as
            “nice-to-have automation”.

        <div class="card-soft">
          <div class="card-label">Adoption dynamic</div>
          <h3>Non-technical teams are the next demand wave</h3>
          <p>
            Legal, operations and risk functions show growing interest in AI but lack tailored
            products. Vendors that solve for auditability, approvals and traceability see faster
            expansion once the first team adopts.

        <h2>How insights are produced</h2>
        <p>
          Each signal is the result of structured research, not a one-off anecdote. We triangulate
          behaviour, sentiment and market structure before calling anything a trend.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="three-col-grid">
        <div class="card-soft">
          <div class="card-label">Behavioural lenses</div>
          <p>
            We analyse how users discover tools, trial them, roll them out and eventually champion or
            abandon them. That includes internal politics, budget friction and risk concerns that
            rarely show up in public narratives.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card-soft">
          <div class="card-label">Advanced data collection models</div>
          <p>
            We combine decision-maker surveys and interviews with models that continuously collect and
            structure open digital signals across communities, product updates and documentation.
            These models let us track sentiment, topics and momentum around tools and workflows over
            time instead of relying on single spikes of attention.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card-soft">
          <div class="card-label">Market mapping</div>
          <p>
            We cluster products into clear categories and track launches, pricing and positioning
            shifts. This helps you see where categories are converging, fragmenting or leaving
            whitespace for new entrants or acquisitions.

        <h2>From signals to action</h2>
        <p>
          In client work, these signals are packaged to support specific moves: which market to
          prioritise, how to position a raise, whether to back a thesis, or how to adjust a roadmap.
